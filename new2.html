  <h1 align="center"> Brothers Grimm </h1>
  <p align="justify"> The Brothers Grimm (die Brüder Grimm or die Gebrüder Grimm), Jacob (1785–1863) and Wilhelm
    (1786–1859), were a brother duo of German academics, philologists, cultural researchers, lexicographers, and authors
    who together collected and published folklore. They are among the best-known storytellers of folk tales,
    popularizing stories such as "Cinderella" ("Aschenputtel"), "The Frog Prince" ("Der Froschkönig"), "Hansel and
    Gretel" ("Hänsel und Gretel"), "Little Red Riding Hood" ("Rotkäppchen"), "Rapunzel", "Rumpelstiltskin"
    ("Rumpelstilzchen"), "Sleeping Beauty" ("Dornröschen"), and "Snow White" ("Schneewittchen"). Their first collection
    of folk tales, Children's and Household Tales (Kinder- und Hausmärchen), began publication in 1812.
  <p align="justify"> The Brothers Grimm spent their formative years in the town of Hanau in the Landgraviate of
    Hesse-Kassel. Their father's death in 1796 (when Jacob was eleven and Wilhelm was ten) caused great poverty for the
    family and affected the brothers many years after. Both brothers attended the University of Marburg, where they
    developed a curiosity about German folklore, which grew into a lifelong dedication to collecting German folk tales.

  <p align="justify"> The popularity of the Grimms' collected folk tales has endured well. The tales are available in
    more than 100 translations and have been adapted by renowned filmmakers, including Lotte Reiniger and Walt Disney,
    with films such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In the mid-20th century, the tales were used as propaganda by
    Nazi Germany; later in the 20th century, psychologists such as Bruno Bettelheim reaffirmed the value of the work in
    spite of the cruelty and violence in original versions of some of the tales, which were eventually sanitized by the
    Grimms themselves.</p>
  <h1 align="center">Biography. Early lives</h1>
  <p align="justify"> In 1796 Philipp Grimm died of pneumonia, causing great poverty for the large family. Dorothea was
    forced to relinquish the brothers' servants and large house, depending on financial support from her father and
    sister, who was then the first lady-in-waiting at the court of William I, Elector of Hesse. Jacob was the eldest
    living son, forced at age 11 to quickly assume adult responsibilities (shared with Wilhelm) for the next two years.
    The two brothers then followed the advice of their grandfather, who continually exhorted them to be industrious.</p>
  <blockquote>The brothers left Steinau and their family in 1798 to attend the Friedrichsgymnasium in Kassel, which had
    been arranged and paid for by their aunt.</blockquote>
  <p align="justify"> In Kassel they became acutely aware of their inferior social status relative to "high-born"
    students who received more attention. Each brother graduated at the head of his class: Jacob in 1803 and Wilhelm in
    1804 (he missed a year of school due to scarlet fever).</p>
